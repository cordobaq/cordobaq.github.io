                                        I designed and deployed business process automation to improve everyday systems where manual effort could be replaced to achieve cost minimization, digital efficiency and streamlined processes.
                                        
                                        One example is development of the Quantum database to communicate directly with approved MRO vendorâ€™s databases where fixed pricing and contracted agreements are in place resulting in reduced headcount for both customer and MRO vendor.
